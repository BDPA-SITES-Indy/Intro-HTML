<h2> Drawing </h2>
<p> Background info: <br> I have been into drawing since I was very young and I continue doing it till this day. <br> 
When I was younger, I was more into painting and popup art <br> with construction paper and I also loved painting <br>
natural scenery but when I got older, I enjoyed doodling and drawing flowers and <br> other
random stuff that would come to mind. </p>

<br>
<p> The image above is an example of what kind of of things I draw. I don't draw anything specific anymore <br> but instead, I just enjoy doodling.</p>

<h2> Skincare </h2>
<p> Background info: <br> I have been into skincare since my early teenage years. I have dealt with a lot of hormonal acne <br> and skin changes so that got 
me into skincare. I never knew what would be the right solution <br> for my skin changes so I always tested out different products <br>
and still do and it gets me excited to try new things and see what works best for me. </p>

<h2> Makeup </h2>
<p> Background info: <br> I haven't been into makeup as long as drawing and skincare but <br> 
I still love doing makeup a lot. I started getting into makeup <br> because I watched 
a lot of youtube videos and found them really fun to watch. <br> I decided to start giving makeup a try on my own
<br> and enjoyed it a lot! </p>
