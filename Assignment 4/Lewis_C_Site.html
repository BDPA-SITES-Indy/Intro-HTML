 <h2> The White Dragon</h2>
 <p> once upon a time there was a boy named pen. Hes nearest neighbor was  9 miles away.
   The harthaways, they both lived in a rural area. Pen was friends with the harthaways daughter Liz.
   They each grew up on a farm. One day they met up and pen wanted to go deeper in the woods then they've
 gone before."you really bringing sushi with ya"pen said a little annoyed. Liz always carries aroud her cat, sushi.
and pen isn't fond of the cat becase it ate his pet mouse. "my feet hurt why don't we just go back"liz whined. "what, we havent even gone that far yet"Pen said.
"well i'm leaving any way"liz said making a sharp turn. Pen groned "Ugg wait up!". they were ready
to turn back when sushi jumped out of lis's arms. "sushi!" liz yelled. Pen grinned "looks like we have to keep going" he said. liz ignoored him and went after sushi.
Pen then followed. After lokking they found sushi outside of a cave. "here sushi!"Liz yelled. Then sushi walked into the cave. "well forget the stupid cat theres probly a bear in there" Pen said
starting to walk away. Liz grabbed his arm and said "wait I think he wants us to follow him" "i'm not follwing that cat in a cave" he said. "come on dont be a wuss" she said. "hey! dont call me that!"
he said defencively. "then come on!" she yelled. "fine" he said with a sigh. They both walked in and found sushi. "ok we foud the stupid cat now lets go"Pen said annoyed.
"um you might want to look at this"liz said. It was a dragon a baby dragon. It was all white and was fluffy ecsept for it's belly and wings. Then they took it home liz named it blossm and pen just went with
it becase it wouldn't respond to any thing else. then he took it in as his pet.The end the story got too long so I shortened it.
